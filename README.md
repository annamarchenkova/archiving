# archiving
Create .zip files of the selected files from selected folders (main and secondary)
Specify the subfolders and files to include into a final zip file. Specify another directory from which to take other necessary files; the directory should contain folders from the `folders` list.

## Example:
Save projects as .zip files including src folder, README and config files, and a requirements file that is located in another directory.
